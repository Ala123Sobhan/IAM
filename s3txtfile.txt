Inline policies are attached directly to IAM entities and are managed within them, 
while customer managed policies are standalone resources that can be shared 
and attached to multiple entities.

Customer managed policies provide more flexibility and reusability 
compared to inline policies.

AWS managed policies are predefined by AWS and are shared 
across accounts, offering commonly needed permissions without
the need for customization.

If a user has administrative permissions and then assumes an AWS read-only role,
the user's permissions will still be based on their original administrative permissions.
Assuming a read-only role does not automatically restrict the user's permissions to read-only.

When a user assumes a role, their permissions are determined by the policies attached 
to the role, not by their original permissions. However, the role's policies only add
or extend the permissions of the user; they do not restrict or remove any existing 
permissions the user already has.
