Inline policies are attached directly to IAM entities and are managed within them, 
while customer managed policies are standalone resources that can be shared 
and attached to multiple entities.

Customer managed policies provide more flexibility and reusability 
compared to inline policies.

AWS managed policies are predefined by AWS and are shared 
across accounts, offering commonly needed permissions without
the need for customization.
